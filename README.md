## 📈 Advanced Features

### Price Elasticity Calculation
The framework calculates price elasticity using the formula:
```
Elasticity = (% Change in Quantity) / (% Change in Price)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Elasticity > 1: Elastic demand (price-sensitive)
- Elasticity < 1: Inelastic demand (price-insensitive)
- Elasticity = 1: Unit elastic

### Dynamic Pricing Algorithm
```python
Dynamic Price = Base Price × Demand Factor × (2 - Supply Factor)
```

**Factors:**
- Demand Factor: 0.6 (Very Low) to 1.6 (Very High)
- Supply Factor: 0.6 (Very High) to 1.5 (Very Low)

### Value-Based Pricing Model
```python
Price = Total Customer Value × Value Capture Rate
Customer ROI = (Value - Price) / Price × 100%
```

## 🎯 Business Applications
